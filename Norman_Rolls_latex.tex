        \section{Encodage réalisé dans le cadre du cours XML TEI du Master 2 TNAH. }
    \end{Large}
        
    \medskip
        
    Cet encodage a été réalisé à partir de la numérisation de l'édition des Norman Rolls disponible sur Internet Archive.
            Le schéma d’encodage choisi pour les Norman Rolls est simple : les actes sont encodés sous forme de listes d’événements pour chaque membrane. 
            Cette structuration organisée du contenu facilite la lisibilité tout en mettant valeur la typologie, la date et la localisation de chaque acte : des informations clés permettant de reconstituer le parcours des Anglais et leur administration du territoire. 
            Les personnes concernées sont signalées au sein de l’encodage de chaque acte puis répertoriées dans une liste présente dans le header. 
            Cela permet d’esquisser le profil des individus mentionnés (activités, statut, lieu de résidence, relations …) et leurs rapports avec le nouveau pouvoir en place : hommages et rébellions, ainsi que les enjeux économiques générés (restitutions, donations … ). 
            A terme, ces succinctes biographies, croisée avec d’autres sources locales (comme les registre du tabellionage de Caen par exemple) pourraient servir à la constitution d’une base prosopographique permettant d’étudier l’attitude des normands, et plus particulièrement de certaines classes sociales, vis-à-vis des Anglais. 
            Une édition interactive (sous forme de carte) des Norman Rolls donnant à la fois accès au contenu des actes et aux informations concernant les individus (prosopographie) tout en retraçant le trajet d’Henry V et de sa chancellerie serait intéressante. 
            Néanmoins, l’encodage manuel de ces rouleaux et le répertoriage de tous les individus mentionnés reste un travail extrêmement chronophage dont l’édition intégrale représenterait une entreprise colossale.
            Toutefois, des chercheurs de l'Université de Southampton ont travaillé à une édition sous forme de tableur (Excel) de la moitié de ces rouleaux. Il serait alors pertinent d'envisager la conception d'une chaîne de traitement permettant la transformation de ce document Excel contenant les éditions en un fichier XML (TEI).

    Les Norman Rolls sont des rouleaux émis par la chancellerie anglaise, contenant l’enregistrement des actes concernant l’administration de la Normandie par les souverains Anglais. 
               La conquête et l’occupation du duché de Normandie par Henry V durant la guerre de Cent Ans donnent lieu à des enrôlements. 
               Les rouleaux concernant cette période sont au nombre de dix, divisés par années de règne. 
               Ils contiennent 810 membranes, 697 d’entre elles comportent des entrées et les actes sont recopiés à la fois sur les faces et les dorsales. 
               Les membranes ont été cousues ensemble à la fin de chaque année de règne, en conséquence, les entrées ne respectent pas un ordre chronologique. 
               La rédaction des actes commence le jour du débarquement du souverain anglais à l'embouchure de la Touques, le 1er août 1417, et se termine juste avant sa mort en 1422. 
               Henry V mène une politique de conciliation entre les habitants et les soldats anglais. 
               Pour cela, une série d'ordonnances disciplinaires relatives aux garnisons et d’actes de donations ou de confirmations de possessions est émise puis enregistrée au sein des Norman Rolls. 
               La typologie des actes est variée : gestion des biens et des personnes (licences, sauf-conduits), administration des localités normandes. 
               La nature des actes donne des indications sur le statut des individus mais aussi sur leurs attitudes vis-à-vis de l’autorité d’Outre-Manche. 
               Pour chaque acte sont en premier indiqués la date et le lieu de rédaction, ce qui contribue à situer les événements dans un contexte spatio-temporel ainsi qu’à restituer une partie des activités de la chancellerie anglaise. 
               Ensuite, leur lecture renseigne sur les lieux concernés et les personnes impliquées de manière assez précise puisque l’on a parfois la mention des activités, des qualités des individus, de leurs possessions ou de leurs liens familiaux. 
               Ces rouleaux représentent une source administrative d’envergure pour l’étude de la période Lancastrienne. 
               Après la mort d’Henry V, ils ont été rapportés en Angleterre pour être conservés dans la Tour de Londres. 
               L’accès à cette source peut se faire en ligne par consultation des éditions anglaises disponibles au sein des quarante et unième et quarante deuxième rapports annuels du conservateur adjoint des archives publiques de 1880 et 1881.
